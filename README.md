# Data-Science-Capstone_Final-project

Project' description
The Final Project aims to a creation of a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. 

A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word. A slide deck consisting of the maximum of five slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching your algorithm and a Shiny app.

The data corpus for this project can be downloaded from (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip)
The data was cleaned using the tm, quanteda packages. These packages has various inbult functions for removing common puntuation, stopswords, numbers, twitter handles etc.The clean data was then combined together for furthur analysis.A sample of 10 percent of the data was used for the project. The N- Grams were created using tokenization. The model algorithm uses the stupid back-off strategy for words prediction.
